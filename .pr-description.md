# Admin Mode - Teacher Authentication

Closes #5

## Overview
This PR implements an admin mode to prevent students from removing each other from activities. Only authenticated teachers can now register and unregister students.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`app.py`)
- ✅ Added authentication system with login/logout endpoints
- ✅ Session token management using secure random tokens
- ✅ Protected signup and unregister endpoints (requires authentication)
- ✅ Teacher credentials loaded from `teachers.json`

### Frontend
- ✅ Added user icon in header for teacher login
- ✅ Created login modal with username/password form
- ✅ Implemented session persistence using localStorage
- ✅ Delete buttons (❌) now only visible to logged-in teachers
- ✅ Sign up form requires teacher authentication

### New Files
- `src/teachers.json` - Teacher credentials storage

## How It Works

1. **Students (not logged in):** Can view activities and participants (read-only)
2. **Teachers (logged in):** Can register and unregister students

## Testing
Login credentials for testing:
- Username: `admin` / Password: `admin123`
- Username: `teacher1` / Password: `teach123`
- Username: `teacher2` / Password: `teach456`

## Security Notes
This is a basic authentication example for demonstration. In production, passwords should be hashed and stored securely.
